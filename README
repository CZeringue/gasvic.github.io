20130107: Proof-of-concept only. Nothing of interest.

# apt-get install python-docutils

20130318: A bit of a merge of this and AMcG's proposed style set.
Note: Content in html/ is used by, and only by, the "reinit" script.

20141224: Reviving this proposal.

What functionality would be lost if we make this change right now?
* Top-level menus would be replaced with index pages. May need some sidebar
menus?
* The shop is not a part of the proposal, and for now would remain as it is
(in Joomla); long-term, there are many options for that, but they would be
separate proposals.
* Formatting. I'm not sure why this is all lost; the previous version had
decent formatting.
* Content needs to be imported from the existing site - it won't carry over
automatically.
* Archive By Decade may not be implemented yet(?)
